# About this repository

This repository contains official sample code for the TwinCAT Automation Interface offered by [Beckhoff Automation](https://www.beckhoff.com). The sample code is provided as-is under the Zero-Clause BSD license.

The Samples are available as VisualStudio solutions here.

# Requirements
VS2015 or newer with installed TwinCAT XAE Package 3.1.4022 or newer

## ScriptingTestContainer

The ScriptionTestContainer demonstrates various aspects of the **TwinCAT XAE Automation Interface**.

The Application starts different scripts selectable by the user. The source code of these scripts is located in the 'Scripts' subfolder. To learn about, just set a breakpoint at **OnExecute** method of the script in the debugger and work through the statements with single step.

The **OnExecute** method itself is called by some infrastructural code that ensures that the script code can be called several types and is setting up / clearing up its preconditions.

Before starting script:

- Detection of VisualStudio / TcXaeShell setups
- Loading VisualStudio / TcXaeShell
- Opening of an temporary TwinCAT solution/project where the script acts

After execution of the script:

- Closing Solution
- Shutting Down VisualStudio/TcXaeShell

## CodeGenerationDemo

The **Code Generation Demo** located in the 'CodeGenerationDemo.sln' solution builds up from the same infrastructure like the **ScriptingTestContainer** demo application. But instead of demonstrating several scripts this demo shows a little application that generates (serial) Machine Configurations and PLC Code basing from a customer order database.

Here the input is coming from an 'Orders.xml' and the different machine options are generated by a combination of Automation Interface Script code and predefined configuration/program templates.
